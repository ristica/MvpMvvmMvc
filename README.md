# MVP / MVVM / MVC with IoC implementation loosely-coupled

Set "Demo.Starter.choose-your-client-technology" as your start project => F5 (RUN) !

The focus of this particular project lies on the reusable architectur of the layers shared between different UI technologies (here => WinForms, WPF, Asp.Net).

It doesn't matter what the targeting UI technology is, the layers up to the UI layer are the same and should be reusable no matter which UI is going to be served.

*** UI and the corresponding pattern's implementation was not of importance ***
